## Smart Contract Overview

MintAsoâ€™s smart contract is designed to handle minting, listing, buying, and transferring NFTs efficiently and securely. Below is a brief overview of the core functionality:

- **Mint Functionality:** Users can mint new NFTs by providing a metadata URL. The minted NFT is assigned a unique token ID and stored on the blockchain.
- **Token Transfers:** Owners can transfer their NFTs to other users. Only the current owner can initiate a transfer.
- **Listing NFTs:** Users can list NFTs for sale by specifying a price and expiry date.
- **Purchasing NFTs:** Buyers can purchase listed NFTs by paying the listed price. The marketplace deducts a small transaction fee from each sale.
- **Paused Marketplace:** The marketplace can be paused by the contract owner in case of updates or emergencies, preventing transactions during that period.

## Smart Contract Functions
